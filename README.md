A prototype Netty embedded servlet bridge for Spring Boot.

Includes basic filter and servlet support. I'm fairly new to Spring Boot, but this approach seems to fit it's opinionated view of the servlet container. Async servlet support isn't yet completed.

Performance
=============

Use the `runTestApp` Gradle task to start the server with the same configuration used here. Tests run with `wrk` with the following arguments:

    wrk -H 'Host: localhost' -H 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -d 120 -c 32 -t 2 http://localhost:8080/plaintext

When compared to a null servlet:

    Running 2m test @ http://localhost:8080/null
      2 threads and 32 connections
      Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev

      5894335 requests in 2.00m, 505.91MB read
    Requests/sec:  49119.58

And to serving the response directly from Netty:
